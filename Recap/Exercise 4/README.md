## Homework Day 3 - Add Courses

- Create a component from where we can add courses.

* Component should be something like the one in the below image.

No description available.

- As you can see we have an input (html input) where you will have to add an onChange event (with this you can ‘capture’ value of the input when is changing and store in our state). We also have an add button where we will add an onClick event(with this we will handle the changes in state where we will keep courses names) and also we have a reset button where we will reset state to the initial one.

Obs:

- The component with Course name should be in another file where we will pass data with props(check parent-child component relation)

* Use hooks

* Forms are not required for this homework so don’t try to understand them or use them

* If you need to see how you can attach onChange or onClick events, check this short examples: https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html?fbclid=IwAR1O5JmMMlp8XGnqp4_Cgm8kmVuW9WjEvQbRaUCUy79hP5QXl_xMiCu2WOU
