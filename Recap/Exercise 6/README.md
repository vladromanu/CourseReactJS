## Homework Day 5 - Flags

- According to the given design, create a page where we can get a list of countries (https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all ). We only need the details from design (name, population, region, capital, flag)

- As you can see we also have a filter and a dropdown where we can choose by region.

  - For filtering by region we have this api https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/region/{region} (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania)

- For filtering by name we can use this api https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/{name} where name can be just a part of name (ex: if we write "ro" it will show all the countries that have "ro" in their name like Romania or Cameroon)
